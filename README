#CouchBook

This web application serves to evaluate couchDB (as a standalone web platform).

The html, js, and css files can all hosted and served to web clients by the database.

###Features:
HTML5 with AJAX for dynamic data updates to the database.
No plugins, addons, libraries, or templates.  Just core javascript, HTML, and CSS.
Tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Blackberry 7.

###Alternatives:
Currently the files are stored as document attachments in the database.  CouchDB has support for 
storing everything in design documents, along with views and "show"s all working together (also templating).

contentEditable could be used rather than changing the field tags.

###Issues:
CouchDB currently doesn't support server sent events (EventSource) in the _changes api but this application
does contain code expecting that.  It is as yet untested.
